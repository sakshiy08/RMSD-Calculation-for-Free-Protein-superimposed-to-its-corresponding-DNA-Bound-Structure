# RMSD-Calculation-for-Free-Protein-superimposed-to-its-corresponding-DNA-Bound-Structure

## Overview
This Python script calculates the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) between the coordinates of a superimposed free protein structure and its corresponding DNA-bound structure, parsed from a PDB file. The RMSD value provides a measure of structural deviation between the two configurations
